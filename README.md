# -This-Is-Me
Here's my first repository to help you understand a little more about me and my organization!

I am Alston V. Abraham!
Just another person interested in coding!
I work with many programming languages and have created some applications by applying some of the programming languages that I know!
I also appreciate the people who code!
Somehow, I think that people involved in any way with computers are special (My way of thinking)!

Anyways, for people involved in using programming languages, 
                                                      "YOU HAVE MY FULL SUPPORT!"
                                                      
Need any help? Feel free to contact me!

As an introduction for people to know me more and my organisation, we offer PREMIUM VERSIONS of any coding-related apps/Aplications-Hosting Apps for free!
For more information on what kinds of apps.... contact us at:
